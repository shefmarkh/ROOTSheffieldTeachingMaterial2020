You can use these notebooks in MyBinder. Navigate to: https://mybinder.org
Then cut and paste this URL, https://github.com/shefmarkh/ROOTSheffieldTeachingMaterial2020, into the GitHub box in the above mybinder.org link.
Then press the "launch" button on the mybinder.org page. Be patient - it can take at least 5 minutes to start up. In the rare case it fails
just refresh the mybinder page and try again.
If you have set up ROOT and installed Jupyer on your own computer you can also use the notebooks there. On linux or macbooks you could
run "root --notebook" from a terminal, assuming you have ROOT and Jupyter installed.
